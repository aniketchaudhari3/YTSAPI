# YTAPI

YTAPI (YouTube Transcribe API) for **[The Abuse Project](https://github.com/theabuseproject)** is a python API (Application Programming Interface) which allows you to get the transcript/subtitle for a given YouTube video in a nice list consisting of dictionaries. It also works for videos which have automatically generated subtitles. It does not use any _hacky mechanisms_.
